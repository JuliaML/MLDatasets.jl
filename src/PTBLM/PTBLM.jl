            WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL STATUS
            Please be aware that this dataset is from a secondary
            source. The provided interface by this package is not
            as developed as those for other datasets. We would
            welcome any contribution to provide this dataset in a
            more mature manner.
            ------------------------------------------------------

            The PTBLM dataset consists of Penn Treebank sentences
            for language modeling, available from tomsercu/lstm.
            The unknown words are replaced with <unk> so that the
            total vocaburary size becomes 10000.

            The files are available for download at the github
            repository linked above. Note that using the data
            responsibly and respecting copyright remains your
            responsibility.
