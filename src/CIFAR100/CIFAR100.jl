                Tech Report, 2009.

            The CIFAR-100 dataset is a labeled subsets of the 80
            million tiny images dataset. It consists of 60000
            32x32 colour images in 100 classes. Specifically, it
            has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are
            500 training images and 100 testing images per class.
            The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20
            superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label
            (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label
            (the superclass to which it belongs).

            The compressed archive file that contains the
            complete dataset is available for download at the
            offical website linked above; specifically the binary
            version for C programs. Note that using the data
            responsibly and respecting copyright remains your
            responsibility. The authors of CIFAR-100 aren't
            really explicit about any terms of use, so please

            the dataset.
