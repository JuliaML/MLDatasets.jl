The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset

- Authors: Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, Andrew Y. Ng
- Website: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers

SVHN was obtained from house numbers in Google Street View
images. As such they are quite diverse in terms of orientation
and image background. Similar to MNIST, SVHN has 10 classes (the
digits 0-9), but unlike MNIST there is more data and the images
are a little bigger (32x32 instead of 28x28) with an additional
RGB color channel. The dataset is split up into three subsets:
73257 digits for training, 26032 digits for testing, and 531131
additional to use as extra training data.
