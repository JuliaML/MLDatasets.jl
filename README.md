This package represents a community effort to provide a common interface for accessing common Machine Learning (ML) datasets. 
In contrast to other data-related Julia packages, the focus of `MLDatasets.jl` is specifically on downloading, unpacking, and accessing benchmark datasets. 
Functionality for the purpose of data processing or visualization is only provided to a degree that is special to some dataset.

This package is a part of the
[`JuliaML`](https://github.com/JuliaML) ecosystem. 
Its functionality is built on top of the package
[`DataDeps.jl`](https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDeps.jl).


## Available Datasets

Datasets are grouped into different categories. Click on the links below for a full list of datasets available in each category.
